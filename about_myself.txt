I went to Glastonbury High School in Glastonbury, Connecticut. Some of my hobbies include playing video games, going to the gym, and watching
moveis and shows too. I also love to watch sports, Football is my favorite with Basketball being a close second. I like the New York Knicks and the Jets, but unfortunately 
they aren't the best right now. There's hope for the Knicks this season though. I've got a dog, her name is Stella. She's a pitbull and she's the cutest and funniest dog ever, 
no argument.
